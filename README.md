**A mobile-first, network-light, community maintained, de-centralized Open Government Data portal.**
- by [Karan Sapolia](https://karansapolia.github.io) and [Contributors]()

_Namaste! 🙏🏻 Hola! Hello! Adaab! Welcome to India.data code repo_
## Aim
_India.data helps you visualize and chart Indian Survey data including [OGD](https://data.gov.in)(Open Government Data) right from your mobile device, without the need of any in-depth knowledge about using CSVs, Excel sheets, etc. The website will provide detailed and interactive maps and charts to infer from the OGD data._

## We already have data.gov.in. Why another data portal?
The Government of India has made a lot of public data available through its data.gov.in portal and made it publicly reusable and accessible to all by following the [Government Open Data License - India](https://data.gov.in/government-open-data-license-india). 

### _Problem_
The data portal provides datasets for personal usage and inference and also offers APIs to use the data in third-party projects and offers data visualizations to a certain extent. But a very critical use-case is not addressed in the current state of the data portal and that is that most of the Citizens of India have mobile devices (mobile phones) as their primary and maybe only computing device. Other that most of these mobile devices access the internet through 4G, 3G and 2G data networks. This implies that there is a need for a data portal which is mobile-friendly and network-light. Currently, data.gov.in does not address this problem and hence widespread public use of Indian Government Data is not possible by citizens at the moment.

#### _Solution_
India.data aims to address this problem. It aims to be a lighweight, mobile-friendly and easy-to-use community maintained data portal which sources data from various publicly available sources and allows all citizens, even those in the remotest of villages to access and infer from OGD data easily.

## Using India.data
The project will be available as a completed website for all to use. You can clone and use the project source code from this repo.
